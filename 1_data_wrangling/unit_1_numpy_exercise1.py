Exercise: Analyzing Weather Data with NumPy

Objective: You are provided with a week's worth of weather data from a small town. The data includes daily maximum temperatures (in Celsius), minimum temperatures, and precipitation levels. Your task is to use NumPy to analyze this data.

Data:

- Max Temperatures: `[25, 28, 22, 19, 30, 27, 26]`
- Min Temperatures: `[15, 18, 14, 12, 20, 17, 16]`
- Precipitation (mm): `[5, 0, 12, 2, 0, 0, 1]`

Tasks:

1. Find the mean max temperature for the week.
2. Find the day with the highest temperature variation (difference between the max and min temperature).
3. Calculate the total precipitation for the week.
4. Determine if any day had precipitation levels above 5 mm.

Exercise #2c: Basic Data Retrieval with Search Engines and Web Scraping
Scenario

Your task is to scrape data from a webpage listing books, extract information about each book, and perform a simple analysis. We'll use the "Books to Scrape" website for this exercise, a demo site for practicing web scraping.

Website for Scraping

Website URL: [http://books.toscrape.com/](http://books.toscrape.com/)

The website lists books with their titles, prices, and ratings.

Tasks
Web Scraping:
Use Python to scrape the first page of the website.
Extract the title, price, and rating for each book.
Data Analysis:
Convert the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Calculate and print the average price of the books.

Implementation

You will need to implement a Python solution for this exercise. Ensure you have the `requests` and `pandas` libraries installed, and optionally `matplotlib` for plotting.
